# Get started with Foton

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  The library is still in the early stages of development and may have breaking changes in the future. If you encounter any problems or have a feature proposal, please create a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/vanishmax/foton/issues)
</Callout>

Foton is a TypeScript toolkit for interacting with TON wallets and blockchain as a whole. The library wraps existing solutions into one comfortable API. It supports:

- ✅ Wallet connection
- ✅ Sending transactions
- ✅ Querying the blockchain
- ✅ Deploying and interacting with smart contracts
- ✅ Blueprint and TON Connect integration for easy code migrations
- ✅ Type safe interfaces with full auto-completion for contract methods and returns

Try creating a simple Counter dApp with React and Foton by following [the tutorial](./docs/guides/tutorial.mdx).

Learn the library by getting familiar with the [clients](./docs/clients.mdx) and their methods.

We appreciate any feedback and contributions! Feel free to open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/VanishMax/foton/issues) or write a message to the [Telegram chat](https://t.me/fotonjs).
